# Stargazer
This repo contains all of the programming projects assigned over the course of the Software Process class I took in college. The assignment details can be found in the excel files in the softwareprocess folder. By the end of the semester I had a program that could perform various astronomy related calculations. 

## Test Driven Development
A big focus of the course was Test Driven Development. In the softwareprocess folder, where all the code is, there is also an Excel file for each assignment. We were required to write tests that would see that those requirements were met, then write code that satisfied the test.
